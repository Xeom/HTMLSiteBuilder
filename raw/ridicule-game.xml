Recently, I’ve been working on a new game, called ridicule. It’s a basic 2D shooter, where you control a space ship (a triangle) and shoot other space ships (other triangles). The enemies will try to kill you.

As always, I’m writing it in JavaScript, and the game can be found here: [mortie.org/?webapp=ridicule](http://mortie.org/?webapp=ridicule)

As of writing this, there isn’t much to do other than moving around and shooting. There is, however, quite a lot of fun you can have in the javascript console;

Try opening the JS console and write this:

> properties.player.fireSpeed = 0

Then you shoot a bit. And move around. Fun, huh?

If your computer isn’t a beast, it may help to reduce the FPS a bit. Try this:

> properties.FPS = 30
> 
> updateGameLoops()

That will set your FPS to 30 (it’s at 120 by default), and then apply the changes by re initiating the game loops.

Another thing you can do, is playing around with the player’s speed and acceleration. Cool values to play around with may be:

> properties.player.speed
> 
> properties.player.acceleration
> 
> properties.player.rotationSpeed
> 
> properties.player.height
> 
> properties.player.width

Tweaking bullet speeds may be fun too, with proeprties.bullet.speed – try combining that with properties.player.fireSpeed, play around and have fun! Break the game!

In case you’re interested in the source code, [it’s available on my GitHub page](https://github.com/mortie/ridicule).
