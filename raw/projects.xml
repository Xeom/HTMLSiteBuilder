Some brainfuck related things.

Brainfuck is a wonderful programming language, concisting of only 8 symbols; , . + - [ ] < >. Using those characters, you can make some quite interesting programs.

The projects consist of a brainfuck interpreter, aswell as a thing
which turns regular text into brainfuck code.
