Programming culture and programming languages
  </span></a>
<p>Experienced programmers tend to have quite strong opinions on programming languages. Therefore, they are an important aspect of nerd culture. Different cults don't simply have different programming languages of choice. It goes much, much deeper than that; not only do they have different languages of choice, they also have forbidden languages. I, for one, am part of a programming "cult". Cult being a Skype chat sprawling with life, and nerds everywhere. In our little community, there are certain rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>C is awesome.</li>
<li>C++ is legal, and one of the better languages. Some consider it as awesome as C, others think the OOP <a href="programming-cultures.html">...<br>

Secure stack loaders and other fancy stuff
  </span></a>
<p>This is a bunch of words from my <a href="http://mortie.org/?webapp=ideaGen">idea generator</a>. Don’t expect to understand… It can be fun to read though :P</p>
<p>With this secure stack loader, we can easily link user machines, depreciating gateway array solvers. Because of this, we were able to significantly improve our communication system preprocessor, and we didn’t even need the bulky threaded replication generator anymore. The consequences of this can be seen in the abstract sequential preprocessor; its performance has been greatly improved when used with the new protected potato utility. </p>

<p>Someone called Xeomorpher made a <a href="http://openredstone.org/forums/showthread.php?tid=685">thread on the Open Redstone Engineers forum</a> (more about ORE some <a href="http://mortie.org/blog/?post=open_redstone_engineers_redstone_server">here</a>), asking what people’s worst pieces of code were. I wrote a response, which I might aswerll post here too:</p>

<p>Made for Ludum Dare with minimal amounts of experience, it’s not of my prettiest of works. It did however spawn some offspring in the form of xeo’s TofuJumper.</p>

Ridicule, my new game
  </span></a>
<p>Recently, I’ve been working on a new game, called ridicule. It’s a basic 2D shooter, where you control a space ship (a triangle) and shoot other space ships (other triangles). The enemies will try to kill you.</p>
<p>As always, I’m writing it in JavaScript, and the game can be found here: <a href="http://mortie.org/?webapp=ridicule">mortie.org/?webapp=ridicule</a></p>
<p>As of writing this, there isn’t much to do other than moving around and shooting. There is, however, quite a lot of fun you can have in the javascript console;</p>
<p>Try opening the JS console and write this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>properties.player.fireSpeed = 0</p>

<p>Then you shoot a bit. And move around. Fun, huh?</p>

Rant about YouTube
  </span></a>
<p>Since its inception in 2005, YouTube has grown out of proportions. It is to videos what Google is to search.</p>
<p>With a user base of billions of people and thousands of hours of footage uploaded daily, you’d almost think they knew what they were doing. And they do, from an infrastructure standpoint – that amount of traffic requires vast server farms all around the world, all working together.</p>
<p>Where YouTube lacks however, is in terms of its user interface. There are some real disasters in this department. </p>

"'Considered Harmful'-essays considered harmful"-essays considered harmful
  </span></a>
<p>Okay, that title is a bit of a brain twister. Hear me out though, I promise I’ll eventually make some kind of sense.</p>
<p>Since the late 60′s, a type of computer-related essays, namely so-called “considered harmful” essays, became popular.</p>
<p>Considered harmful essays are all about writing page up and page down about why something programming related is bad and should be avoided. The first considered harmful essay, at least the first somewhat mainstream one, was written in 1968 by the Dutchman <strong>Edsger W. Dijkstra </strong>(however you’d pronounce that..). It was called “<a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_To_Considered_Harmful.html">Go To Statements Considered Harmful</a>“, and, as you might have <a href="considered-harmful.html">...<br>

A small WTF regarding CSS units

<p>CSS. A tool loved by web developers all over the world. It lets us style our HTML easily, and creates somewhat loose coupling between content and layout.</p>
<p>CSS. A tool hated by web developers all over the world. It makes us spend countless hours trying to accomplish what seemed to be the most mundane task.</p>

Drum mics!

<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, I bought some drum mics. I've gotten around to recording a few drum covers, both of Metallica's songs.</p>
<p>Metallica's cover of Misfits' "Die, Die My Darling":</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, there are some places where I have trouble keeping up. All in all I'm pretty pleased with the result though.</p>
<p><strong>Now over to the mic setup.</strong> I bought a kit with eight mics, and used my dad's old mixer. The mixer doesn't have quite enough inputs though, so I haven't hooked up the mic for the high hat. It's not <a href="drum-mics.html">...<br>

Open Redstone Engineers redstone server

<p>Some time ago, I and a few internet friends started a redstone server and network called “Open Redstone Engineers”, or ORE for short, revolving around the redstone aspect in Minecraft. I wrote a bit of it in my <a href="?page_id=26">“about me” page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For you who don’t know, Minecraft’s redstone is kind of like a computer electronics environment – you build gates like XOR gates, AND gates, IMPLIES gates, etc. All the gates you may know from computer science. Out of those gates, we build all kinds of crazy stuff like adders, CPUs, computers, etc. Sounds really nerdy, and I guess it <a href="openredstone.html">...<br>

<p>What about those late nights you’ve been awake, not being able to sleep because you’ve wondered how it’d be to be trapped in a seemingly endless, uniform cave, full of pits of some kind of bright red goo, possibly lava? </p>

Fare well, Wordpress!

<p>Up until now, I've been using WordPress for my blog. Not anymore.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I started working on a new "blogging platform", or "content management system" (CMS). It's basically a system which manages the website - I just write a blog post in a web interface, press "submit", and it ends up on the front page as a new post.</p>
<p>This is a lot of the reason I've been quiet here lately. I haven't lost interest in the blog. Rather the contrary; I've been busy working on it. I just didn't want to make new posts until I was done <a href="farewell-wordpress.html">...<br>

JavaScript's Rough Childhood
  </span></a>
<p>As some of you may know, I’m a fan of JavaScript. Pretty much all of <a href="http://mortie.org/?page_id=28">my projects</a> are web apps, and as such, JavaScript is an important part of them.</p>
<p>JavaScript does have it’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596517742">good parts</a>. Parts which at the very least are en par with other languages. It does, however, also have quite a bit of bad parts.</p>
<p>In the beginning, there was Brendan Eich. Eich got hired by Netscape to design a programming language for their web browser. At first, what he had in mind was something resembling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>, a dialect of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language">Lisp</a>.</p>

Yet another "types of programmers"-post

<p>I and some friends were hanging out in a Google Docs-document earlier, and made our own "types of programmers"-list. The result:</p>
<p><strong>The kinda-master:</strong></p>
<p>This kind of programmer always assumes they know best, and commits without any testing, often breaking sections of the code. They invent unusual methods of doing things, and insist they are the best, especially when they are not. They are very skilled at many things, and assume this translates to everything.</p>
<p><strong>The Delusional:</strong></p>
<p>This kind of programmer takes knowing more than the average person to be knowing more than any person. They code badly and refuse to improve, under the impression <a href="programmer-types.html">...<br>

Transgenderism, an injustice at every turn

<p>This is a kind of topic I don't usually cover in this blog. I wrote this essay as an assignment at school where we were supposed to write about a topic related to multiculturalism. It's an extremely important topic though, which gets far less attention than it deserves. That's why I'm posting it here.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that I don't have extensible knowledge on the subject. I've read about it a bit and made up thoughts myself, so I may very well be wrong somewhere. Feel free to tell me tell me I'm wrong in the comments, and I'll do my <a href="transgenderism.html">...<br>
