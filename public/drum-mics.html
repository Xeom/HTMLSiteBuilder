Drum mics!
  </span>
<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, I bought some drum mics. I've gotten around to recording a few drum covers, both of Metallica's songs.</p>
<p>Metallica's cover of Misfits' "Die, Die My Darling":</p>

<p>Metallica's "Cyanide":</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, there are some places where I have trouble keeping up. All in all I'm pretty pleased with the result though.</p>
<p><strong>Now over to the mic setup.</strong> I bought a kit with eight mics, and used my dad's old mixer. The mixer doesn't have quite enough inputs though, so I haven't hooked up the mic for the high hat. It's not as advanced as I'd wished either.</p>
<p>Eventually, I want to get the money for a full blown USB or thunderbolt audio interface, giving me a lot more control. For now though, I'm fairly pleased with the audio quality. My biggest gripe is just that the kick is hard to hear.</p>
