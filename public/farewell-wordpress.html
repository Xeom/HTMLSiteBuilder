<p>Up until now, I've been using WordPress for my blog. Not anymore.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I started working on a new "blogging platform", or "content management system" (CMS). It's basically a system which manages the website - I just write a blog post in a web interface, press "submit", and it ends up on the front page as a new post.</p>
<p>This is a lot of the reason I've been quiet here lately. I haven't lost interest in the blog. Rather the contrary; I've been busy working on it. I just didn't want to make new posts until I was done with this project.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Why'd I write a whole content management system myself, instead of just keep using Wordpress?</p>
<p><strong>Because I can.</strong> That's the biggest reason probably. I did something as a homework for school, and realised what I had made could be expanded into a CMS.</p>
<p><strong>Because I have full control.</strong> There have been times when I was annoyed by how my blog looks or functions, but haven't known enough of WordPress' internals to fix it myself. I also had to be careful not to do changes which could break on the next update.</p>
<p><strong>Because it's mine.</strong> When I've shown my blog to others, I've not felt I could say I made the site. After all, all I did was to configure WordPress and write the content. As a result, every time I've showed someone the blog, I've tried to briefly explain what wordpress is, or something equally awkward.</p>
<p>Now though, I can simply say "yes". "Yes, I made it". All of it. Every line of PHP or HTML, every stylesheet - all now made by me.</p>
<p>It's not perfect yet. I'd assume there still are some issues. If you encounter any, feel free to shout at me in the comment section!</p>
<p>I know it still has "a few" HTML errors. Will fix those later. EDIT: HTML errors fixed! This now validates perfectly in the W3C validator.</p>
<p>As always, <a href="https://github.com/mortie/blogsoftware">my source code is available at GitHub</a></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Adding a bit of technical information:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's no user system. I figured it'd be easier to just let anyone post without registering.</li>
<li>It's written in PHP. No frameworks used, except for charts.js for a graph in the admin interface.</li>
